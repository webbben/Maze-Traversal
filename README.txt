Description:
------------
This program uses an A* searching algorithm to find a path in any solvable maze. It can read a maze from a text file
in the format of 1 and 0, where 1 represents a wall and 0 represents an open space that can be navigated. You can
make your own mazes, or use one of the provided maze text files.

How to run:
-----------
* run rv1.py to run the maze solving algorithm on a preset maze.
* To change the maze, change "board.txt" for the board variable to a different file name.
